# Social Media Insights: Analyzing Engagement by Category

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data to uncover engagement trends across key categories: **health**, **family**, and **food**. By leveraging Python and natural language processing techniques, the project provides actionable insights to optimize social media strategies. The analysis includes cleaning and categorizing tweets, identifying engagement patterns, and creating interactive visualizations.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes noise such as URLs, special characters, and stopwords to standardize text.
- **Tweet Categorization**: Automatically classifies tweets into predefined categories based on keywords.
- **Data Analysis**: Explores tweet distribution, common words, and engagement metrics (likes and retweets).
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts using Plotly to illustrate key insights.
- **Export Functionality**: Saves cleaned and categorized data for further use.

## Project Goals
1. Help marketers and analysts improve social media performance.
2. Provide data-driven recommendations to increase reach and engagement.
3. Deliver actionable insights through clear and interactive visualizations.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - NLTK: Natural language processing
  - Plotly: Interactive data visualization
  - re: Regular expressions for text cleaning

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or later installed.
2. Required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas nltk plotly
   ```
3. Download the dataset (`twitter_dataset.csv`) and place it in the project directory.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
4. Run the code cells in sequence to:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Categorize tweets.
   - Analyze and visualize data.
   - Save the processed data.

### Output
- **Visualizations**: Distribution of tweets by category, top common words, and engagement analysis.
- **Processed Data**: Cleaned and categorized data saved as a CSV file.

## Example Insights
- Categories with the highest engagement metrics.
- Common keywords driving user interaction.
- Recommendations for improving content in specific categories.
